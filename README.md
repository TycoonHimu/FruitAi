Fruit App

A web application for managing and interacting with a list of fruits.
The app features a login page, home page with services, a chatbot, a translator, and an about page. 
The frontend is built using React, and the backend is developed with Flask.
I have also created the backend uisng Node.

Project Design Decisions
Frontend

    React: Chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easier to manage UI and state.
    CSS: Used for styling with media queries to ensure responsiveness across devices.
    Flexbox and Grid: Used for layout adjustments to ensure the design adapts well to different screen sizes.

Backend

    Flask: Selected for its simplicity and flexibility in creating APIs.
    RESTful API: Designed endpoints following REST principles for clear and consistent interaction with the frontend.
    Error Handling: Implemented proper error responses for robustness and better user experience.

Design Considerations

    Responsiveness: Ensured that the application is mobile-friendly, with adjustments for various screen sizes.
    Usability: Focused on user-friendly interfaces with intuitive navigation and clear call-to-action buttons.
    Performance: Optimized both frontend and backend for quick load times and efficient data handling.
